Permalize
==========

Following after some Ruby and Rails conventions, such as camelize, pluralize, titleize, etc, I've created permalize. Basically, it takes any string and makes it into a permanent link. See the examples below.

Example
=======

There are two ways you can use this plugin. 1)

string = "Here is the new string"
new_string = string.permalize

new_string will now be permalized, but string will still be "Here is the new string"

2)

string = "Here is the new string"
string.permlize!
